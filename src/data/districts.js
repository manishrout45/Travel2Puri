      description: `A majestic echo of Cuttack's splendour.
In the heart of Cuttack, Odisha, the Barabati Fort rises majestically, casting a nostalgic spell that transports one to a bygone era of splendour and valour. Once a shining emblem of Odia architecture and military might, the fort now stands as a silent sentinel, its glorious history whispering through the wilderness that surrounds it.
Situated in Barabati, near the merging waters of the mighty Mahanadi and Kathjodi rivers, this fortress occupies a strategic position that once brimmed with life and activity. Beyond its role as a formidable military stronghold, the fort was a bustling centre of trade and culture. It was here that the annual Bali Jatra, a tradition tracing the maritime adventures of Odia sailors to Southeast Asia, found its genesis, infusing the fort with tales of seafaring glory.
Today, amid the modernity of the Millennium City, the remnants of Barabati Fort stand in silent juxtaposition to the vibrant energy of the Barabati Stadium. It is said that this ancient bastion once housed a nine-storey palace. It sprawls across 102 acres of land, its grandeur softened by the passage of time. Yet, it remains guarded by a 20-yard-wide moat, a vestige of its former defences, now adorned with tranquil hyacinths.
<br>
<b>A storied past</b>
<br>
The precise origins of Barabati Fort remain shrouded in debate, with legends attributing its construction to King Anangabhima II in the 12th century, while historical records suggest a timeframe between 1229 and 1238 AD. Throughout its storied history, the fort bore witness to the ebb and flow of power, serving as the seat of authority for both Ganga and Suryavanshi rulers. During periods of Muslim and Maratha rule, Cuttack even held the prestigious status of being the capital of Odisha; thus this fort became the seat of power.
In 1803, the British Empire added another chapter to the fort's narrative, capturing it and repurposing it as a prison for captured rulers. However, amidst these varying accounts, the legend recounted in Madalapanji, the Jagannatha temple chronicle, offers a captivating tale. According to this narrative, King Bhima Parichha, or Anangabhima II, was drawn to the site of Barabati village, situated in the Ko-danda sub-division, by a remarkable scene of nature. Witnessing a heron triumphantly perched atop a hawk near the deity Visweswar Deva, the king was struck with awe and deemed the moment auspicious. Inspired by this encounter, he ceremoniously laid the fort's foundation, christening the village as Barabati Cuttack and establishing it as his new capital, forever intertwining its destiny with that of the fort.
<br>
<b>Architectural splendour</b>
<br>
Stretching across a vast expanse of 102 acres, the fortress of Barabati, though now mostly in ruins, retains echoes of its former grandeur. Dominating the landscape are remnants like the towering laterite gateway and the central earthen mound, poignant reminders of its illustrious past. Through archaeological excavations, glimpses of the fortress's former glory emerge, revealing traces of a once magnificent palace adorned with pillars and evidence of a formidable citadel wall. However, the ravages of time, compounded by acts of vandalism during the early British rule and natural encroachment, have left their mark on the fort's structure. Once hailed as the pinnacle of Odia architecture and craftsmanship, the ancient imperial citadel of Barabati now stands as a solemn testament to a bygone era. Swathed in dense foliage and enveloped by the embrace of nature, it bears witness to the passage of time and the vicissitudes of history. As the seat of political power and civil-military administration for centuries, this venerable fortress has borne witness to the rise and fall of kings and empires, weathering wars, betrayals, and invasions. Today, it serves as an emotional reminder of Odisha's enduring pride, a silent sentinel guarding the legacy of generations past.
The Barabati Fort, with its moat choked by weeds and the lone Sahi Quila Mosque (Fateh Khan Mosque) standing tall, awaits restoration. Plans are underway to develop the surrounding area into a tourist destination. Hopefully, these efforts will breathe new life into this witness of Cuttack's ancient history.`
