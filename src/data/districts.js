      description: `A majestic echo of Cuttack's splendour.
In the heart of Cuttack, Odisha, the Barabati Fort rises majestically, casting a nostalgic spell that transports one to a bygone era of splendour and valour. Once a shining emblem of Odia architecture and military might, the fort now stands as a silent sentinel, its glorious history whispering through the wilderness that surrounds it.
Situated in Barabati, near the merging waters of the mighty Mahanadi and Kathjodi rivers, this fortress occupies a strategic position that once brimmed with life and activity. Beyond its role as a formidable military stronghold, the fort was a bustling centre of trade and culture. It was here that the annual Bali Jatra, a tradition tracing the maritime adventures of Odia sailors to Southeast Asia, found its genesis, infusing the fort with tales of seafaring glory.
Today, amid the modernity of the Millennium City, the remnants of Barabati Fort stand in silent juxtaposition to the vibrant energy of the Barabati Stadium. It is said that this ancient bastion once housed a nine-storey palace. It sprawls across 102 acres of land, its grandeur softened by the passage of time. Yet, it remains guarded by a 20-yard-wide moat, a vestige of its former defences, now adorned with tranquil hyacinths.
<br>
<b>A storied past</b>
<br>
The precise origins of Barabati Fort remain shrouded in debate, with legends attributing its construction to King Anangabhima II in the 12th century, while historical records suggest a timeframe between 1229 and 1238 AD. Throughout its storied history, the fort bore witness to the ebb and flow of power, serving as the seat of authority for both Ganga and Suryavanshi rulers. During periods of Muslim and Maratha rule, Cuttack even held the prestigious status of being the capital of Odisha; thus this fort became the seat of power.
In 1803, the British Empire added another chapter to the fort's narrative, capturing it and repurposing it as a prison for captured rulers. However, amidst these varying accounts, the legend recounted in Madalapanji, the Jagannatha temple chronicle, offers a captivating tale. According to this narrative, King Bhima Parichha, or Anangabhima II, was drawn to the site of Barabati village, situated in the Ko-danda sub-division, by a remarkable scene of nature. Witnessing a heron triumphantly perched atop a hawk near the deity Visweswar Deva, the king was struck with awe and deemed the moment auspicious. Inspired by this encounter, he ceremoniously laid the fort's foundation, christening the village as Barabati Cuttack and establishing it as his new capital, forever intertwining its destiny with that of the fort.
<br>
<b>Architectural splendour</b>
<br>
Stretching across a vast expanse of 102 acres, the fortress of Barabati, though now mostly in ruins, retains echoes of its former grandeur. Dominating the landscape are remnants like the towering laterite gateway and the central earthen mound, poignant reminders of its illustrious past. Through archaeological excavations, glimpses of the fortress's former glory emerge, revealing traces of a once magnificent palace adorned with pillars and evidence of a formidable citadel wall. However, the ravages of time, compounded by acts of vandalism during the early British rule and natural encroachment, have left their mark on the fort's structure. Once hailed as the pinnacle of Odia architecture and craftsmanship, the ancient imperial citadel of Barabati now stands as a solemn testament to a bygone era. Swathed in dense foliage and enveloped by the embrace of nature, it bears witness to the passage of time and the vicissitudes of history. As the seat of political power and civil-military administration for centuries, this venerable fortress has borne witness to the rise and fall of kings and empires, weathering wars, betrayals, and invasions. Today, it serves as an emotional reminder of Odisha's enduring pride, a silent sentinel guarding the legacy of generations past.
The Barabati Fort, with its moat choked by weeds and the lone Sahi Quila Mosque (Fateh Khan Mosque) standing tall, awaits restoration. Plans are underway to develop the surrounding area into a tourist destination. Hopefully, these efforts will breathe new life into this witness of Cuttack's ancient history.`

Lingaraj Temple was called “The finest example of Hindu temples in India" by the historian James Fergusson. It is one of the oldest and most revered temples in Odisha. This temple is dedicated to not one but two primary deities, Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu. Thus, symbolizing the coming together of Shaivism and Vaishnavism, two prominent sects of Hinduism. Welcome to the Lingaraj Temple, an awe-inspiring monument. 
<br>
Commissioned in the 11th century by King Jajati Keshari of the Somvanshi dynasty, this sacred site enshrines a Swayambhu (self-manifested) Shivalinga, measuring 8 feet in diameter and 8 inches in height. Yet, legends suggest that the Shivalinga within the temple was being worshipped as early as the 7th century.
<br>
While access to the temple is restricted to Hindus, non-Hindu visitors can still admire the entire temple complex and capture its splendour from a designated elevated platform.
<br>
Inside, the hallowed corridors are adorned with vivid depictions from Hindu mythology narrating the intriguing tales of gods and goddesses.
<br>
Annually, crowds of pilgrims converge here to seek blessings and divine favour from Lord Shiva, particularly during revered festivals like Mahashivratri and Ashokastami, celebrated with fervour within the temple precincts. Lingaraj Temple is the only ancient temple in Bhubaneshwar where worship is still prominent today, unlike other temples.
<br>
<b>A story in Sandstone</b><br>
Situated within the expansive temple complex, the imposing Lingaraj Temple towers 180 feet high. Unmistakable even from a distance, the temple beckons you to discover the wonders inside.
<br>
Once you enter, you will find that the temple complex is over 40 acres in size. The courtyard itself is home to 150 smaller shrines interspersed throughout. Crafted in the Kalinga architectural style, the temple is embellished with exquisitely sculpted masterpieces gracing its walls. Its primary entrance graces the eastern facade, while smaller gates adorn the southern and northern perimeters.
<br>
The shrine's entrance porch gate has been constructed using sandalwood. Sandstone and laterite are the two major components used in the construction of the temple. 
<br>
The temple unfolds its architectural splendour through four main sections: the temple tower (Vimana), the assembly hall (Jagamohana), the festival hall (Nata Mandira), and the hall of offering (Bhoga Mandapa). The towering Vimana serves as the central sanctum, intricately adorned from its summit to its base.
<br>
Adjacent to it, the Jagamohana is graced by two entrance gates adorned with perforated windows featuring lion motifs. The Nata Mandira boasts two side entrances and a central doorway, with its walls adorned by intricately sculpted figures depicting couples and women.
<br>
Completing the ensemble, the Bhoga Mandapa features a pyramidal roof crowned with an inverted bell. At the same time, its exterior walls are adorned with sculptures of beasts and men.
<br>
These halls gradually ascend in height from the Bhoga Mandapa to the Vimana, symbolizing spiritual elevation and progression.
<br>
<b>Graced by resilience</b><br>
Despite enduring the ravages of natural calamities and invasions throughout its history, the Lingaraj Temple remains steadfast. Following a destructive earthquake in the 16th century that inflicted considerable structural damage, the temple underwent a thorough restoration process led by skilled artisans of antiquity, ensuring the perpetuation of its timeless magnificence for future generations.`

        description: `Kosalesvara temple or Kosaleswara temple located at Baidyanatha of Subarnapur district, Odisha, India. In the balcony of the brick-built jagamohana hall of this temple a peculiar Kirtimukha head is carved on brick. From the mouth of this kirtimukha a bunches of leaves are flowing down. Such arts are found carved on the Laksmanesvara temple located at Sirpur of the Chhattisgarh state, which was built on 8th century.
<br>
The Kosaleswar temple at Baidyanath on the bank of river Tel, situated about 14km. to the south-east of Subarnapur is now in a very bad state of preservation. The structure even in its ruins is a remarkable monument. The temple provides striking features of an earlier Buddhist shrines refurnished by the Hindus. Large sized bricks, polished and well set mortar, inter columnation and isolated niches to hold individual images, all .Buddhist structural features are met in Kosaleswar temple which has led scholars like Charls Fabri to suppose that this temple was built on the ruins of a Buddhist monument.
<br>
But, the structural details of the temple suggest that it belongs to a much later period. Here iron bars were used and the earliest use of such iron bars in the Odishan temple is noticed in the Simhanath temple of Gopinathpur in Cuttack district, which has assigned to a date not earlier than the 9th. century A.D. On the lintel of the doorway of Kosaleswar temple all the nine planets are depicted which seems to be a later development. However, the opinion of Charls Fabri that Kosaleswar temple was originally a Buddhist structure refurnished by the Hindus appears to be a conjecture.
<br>
The architecture and sculptures of this temple are the best specimens of plastic art, which can be dated to about 7th century A.D. or even earlier. Again, the two handed image of Kartikeya provides comparatively an early date to the temple. The figures of Gods and celestials are provided with haloes around their hands, which is also an early feature. But basing on the structural detail N.K.Sahu is of the opinion that the Kosaleswar temple was constructed during the reign of the Telugu -Chodas in the last part of 11th century A.D. or 12th century A.D. There is a clear reference in one copper plate record that Baidyanath (now known as Kosaleswar) was the tutelary deity of the Telugu-Choda ruling family. So the architectural and the iconographic features of the temple of Kosaleswar very often are self contradictory and do not help in arriving at a conclusion to find out the initial period of the construction of the temple.`
